# led-tape-lighting-project
This project is made up of two main components, a Java and Python program that runs on a Raspberry PI and an Android application. The Raspberry Pi controls some connected SMD5050 RGB LED tape and the application is connected to a Google Firebase database. This allows the lights to be controlled from the mobile application.
